# Desktop Go

Work in WSL, and make sure you have Go-1.19 installed.

Install the dependencies with `go get`.

You can run the project with `go run main.go`.

You can build it for Linux with `go build main.go`, or for Windows (with MingW set up - `sudo apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64`) with `build-for-windows.sh`.

Run the tests with `go test ./...`.
